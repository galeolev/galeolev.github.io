title: "Optimal error estimates of a time-spectral method for fractional diffusion problems with low regularity data"
excerpt: "A novel dynamical inertial Newton system, which is called Hessian-driven Nesterov accelerated gradient (H-NAG) flow is proposed. Convergence of the continuous trajectory are established via tailored Lyapunov function, and new first-order accelerated optimization methods are proposed from ODE solvers. It is shown that (semi-)implicit schemes can always achieve linear rate and explicit schemes have the optimal(accelerated) rates for convex and strongly convex objectives. In particular, Nesterovâ€™s optimal method is recovered from an explicit scheme for our H-NAG flow. Furthermore, accelerated splitting algorithms for composite optimization problems are also developed."
