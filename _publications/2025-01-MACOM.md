excerpt: 'This paper provides a self-contained ordinary differential equation solver approach for separable con- vex optimization problems. A novel primal-dual dynamical system with built-in time rescaling factors is introduced, and the exponential decay of a tailored Lyapunov function is established. Then several time dis- cretizations of the continuous model are considered and analyzed via a unified discrete Lyapunov function. Moreover, two families of accelerated proximal alternating direction methods of multipliers are obtained, and nonergodic optimal mixed-type convergence rates shall be proved for the primal objective residual, the feasi- bility violation and the Lagrangian gap. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to validate the practical performances.'
