excerpt: 'Convergence analysis of accelerated first-order methods for convex optimization problems are developed from the point of view of ordinary differential equation solvers. 
A new dynamical system, called Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) flow, is derived from the connection between acceleration mechanism and A-stability of ODE solvers, and the 
exponential decay of a tailored Lyapunov function along with the solution trajectory is proved. 
Numerical discretizations of NAG flow are then considered and convergence rates are established via a discrete Lyapunov function. 
The proposed differential equation solver approach can not only cover existing accelerated methods, such as FISTA, Güler’s proximal algorithm and 
Nesterov’s accelerated gradient method, but also produce new algorithms for composite convex 
optimization that possess accelerated convergence rates. 
Both the convex and the strongly convex cases are handled in a unified way in our approach.'
